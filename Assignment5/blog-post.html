        <p>
            For my next website I plan to make a sort of personal portfolio. Over these semesters in school, I have acquired a few pieces of work that I would like to catagorize
            sort. It would include a home page explaining what the website is and have buttons with links leading to each category of art I have and linkm it to an about me page.
            I think I would want my categories to be sorted into the different programs that were used as the main page titles, and then categorize those pieces on the pages into 
            what they were meant for, either for a professional/career setting or for more artistic reasons. It would be nice to start building this for myself to use and expand upon in the future 
            to show my work to other people.
