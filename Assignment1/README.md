# Reflection
I did not recieve any personal feedback on my own post so I chose to observe feedback left on others post to change some pieces of my own. I chose to make a margain to keep the text from going so far to the edges of the screen and make it easier for viewers to read. I also chose to play around with the sizing of the text for all headers and body text to be more accessible and also easier to read. I also tried to play with fonts to add some more style to keep with the vibe of the book and match the site

I chose these specific changes because I felt like the way it was previously was a bit hard to read and wasn't pleasing to the eye. I think adding the margains in helped everything look more central. It also helps to get on track to making the site more pleasing and professional. Also, the smaller body text from before made it really hard to read, even with the strong contrast. As somone who struggles reading, small texts in certain fonts really messes with my brain and i will not be able to take in the information. So, both the size and font were changed for my benefit as well.
