<h1> The Miracoulous Journey of Edward Tulane</h1>
<h2> A book by Kate DiCamillo</h2>
<h3> Chapter 1</h3>
<p> I read this book as a kid, it was my first novel I ever read and the story was very intriguing to read for me. I have been wanting to get a 
    copy and read it again as an adult but I haven't remembered to and haven't had the chance yet. It's about a toy bunny owned by a girl 
    travelling across on a ship, and he ends up getting lost and follows his path through differnt people and owners. I am not much of a reader, 
    but I loved this book.</p>
