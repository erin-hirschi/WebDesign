# WebDesign
I think I'm following this website building pretty well and doing good. I think I might try to make my own website as a sort of digital portfolio to keep track of all my digital work. I have a lot of projects from school and work that I would like to keep in a website just to have.

Still think all the instructions are super clear and helpful, they are truly making it super easy to be able to keep up with the class and I'm really thankful for it.

This module was super fun and I think it was nice to see everbody expand their websites and create things that all look so different to eachother.
