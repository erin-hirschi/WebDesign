<h1> The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane</h1>

<h2> A book by Kate DiCamillo</h2>


<p> I read this book as a kid, it was my first novel I ever read and the story was very intriguing to read for me. I have been wanting to get a 
    copy and read it again as an adult but I haven't remembered to and haven't had the chance yet. It's about a toy bunny owned by a girl 
    travelling across on a ship, and he ends up getting lost and follows his path through differnt people and owners. I am not much of a reader, 
    but I loved this book.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3> Chapter 1</h3>
</div>

<p> In chapter 1, we are introduced to Edward Tulane's life as a white porcelain rabbit. He was a gift to a little girl named Abilene from her grandmother. Abilene treats him as a living object. She dresses him in fancy clothes to match their wealthy family, sje sits him in his special chair, and winds his gold watch every night. This chapter sets teh story and establishes relationships between Edward and his personality. 
    He can be quite pompous and arrogant at times feeling disrespected by Abilene's parents. The point of this chapter is to show a lot of Edwards attitude and characteristics. It's important because this book is all about Edward's journey in learning about loss and moving on to have more love in his heart. Throughout the book we learn that loss is never the end and we can always have a new beginning.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3> Chapter 8</h3>
</div>

<p> In the few previous chapters, Edward is brought along the family trip to London on a ship. There's a storm and Edward has gone off the boat into the sea. Edward is heart broken being seperated from Abilene and is worried about spending the rest of his life at the bottom of the ocean. Until a fisherman gets him from the water and takes him home and gifts him to a lady named Nellie. He explains to Edward that Nellie has experienced sadness recently and hopes Edward can brighten her spirits. 
    She sees him and lights up immeadiately and takes him as her own right away. From this he learns he is valuable and can be loved by another. He stills love Abilene, but knows he may never see her again. He learns that is ok and can find new love for Nellie.

<h3>Chapter 27</h3>
</div>

<p> We skip to the last chapter of the book for the (spoiler alert) great and feel good ending. Eventually Edward is seperated from Nellie and is transferred through multiple owners, learning to connect to each one and love them each individually. He has to lose each of them to understand the power of apprciating and having a place for them in his heart. In the end he is set up for sale in a little shop. He sits and waits to be taken and love another person. After bein g through so many, he isn't quite the well taken care of, spiffy porcelain bunny he once was. He is broken in the head and is dirty.
     Nonetheless, he waits and is hopeful someone will come. Then a little girl named Maggie comes in and instanly loves Edward. She refuses to let the shop owner sway her attraction to Edward but refuses. Her mother comes over to see the fuss and is shocked. Edward notices his gold pocket watch hung as a necklace around her neck. It was Abilene all grown with a daughter. He had grown fond of all of those who took care of him before, but at the end of the day, 
     he always waited to be back with Abilene.
